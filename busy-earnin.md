## Busy Earnin'
Pretty much the summer after I finished the night course in C, I had the opportunity to work for a local software development company during the summer. This was in 1995 if I remember correctly. The main business they were involved in was developing software for SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems, they also did little bits of consultancy on the side, amongst which web development was one of the offerings.

### Making Tea
Prime amongst my responsibilities were tea making duties, and buying sausage rolls. Navigating narrow stairs with a tray full of scalding tea and coffee was a hard won skill I can tell you.

### Building Sites
As well as lugging liquid down narrow stairs, I also got to build websites for local companies, HTML written in notepad, testing in IE 2.0 and Netscape Navigator, with bonus resplendent animated gifs of spinning envelopes, indicating that yes, you should indeed click here to email us.

One of the more ridiculous things I recall from back then was the magical HTML Image Map, where we had this scanned image from a magazine of a house split up into clickable links...

### Testing
As well as the 'web design' I also did a lot of software testing, and I mean a LOT. The company was releasing a new version of it's software and it needed to be tested significantly, this was in the days before Continuous Integration and heavily automated testing.

I got to develop test scripts, with scenarios for various flavors of operating systems, and on top of this run through them, including installing the OS (Windows NT 3.51) and the software over and over again. It was a valuable lesson in consistency, developing some level of automation (I had a fairly good process in place based on timings for various parts of the task) and how to think about actually doing QA on a system, rather than just simple unit level testing.

### Not Strictly Business
There were some other things I discovered during my time working over the summer, getting introduced to things like newsgroups, message boards and IRC and spent the odd hour here and there reading about hacking and phreaking.
