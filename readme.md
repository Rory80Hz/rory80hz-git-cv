# From Zero to Principal Architect
## Introduction
### What the hell is this?
This is a story about how I travelled through time to my current work position. It is a living CV, documented with git branches, detailing not just work expierence, but experience in general. 

CV is the wrong word. We are badly served by CV's.

They are a checklist of buzz words, we all know we twist and turn them in different ways to suit the job description presented, to sell yourself into a role, to sell a role to a client, to sell an idea...we all know how it works, you stick in the relevant experience tailored to fit the bill, the recipient scans it for blatant lies and inconsistencies, barely reaches passed year 3 or 4 on the list and decides whether you are worth a closer look.

The person you are is much more than that...it is years of collected experience, decision and indecision, events beyond our control, seemingly unconnected ideas, interests and opportunities. 

Hence this little experiment. It was born out of a conversation with [Peter Campbell](https://medium.com/@petecam) Kainos Gov BU CTO, where we wanted to figure what it is that made us the people we are, why we are in the roles we found ourselves in, there must be something more than just time served amongst 'Enterprise' architecture and beyond, more than sticking down really unhelpful tags on a CV like 'XPATH EXPERT'.

### Right Now.
This is the bit that will change as time goes by, but right now, I am Principal Architect with Kainos, working in their Gov BU, currently engaged with GDS as Product Manager for the Government PaaS offering.

PaaS done right is a massive game changer, so this a super cool thing to be involved in. I'm also massively interested in how to make things better for teams building services, users as a first class citizen, design, security, operations and testing. (Yeah right, you are mad into everything? Yes...pretty much, why? well, thats the point of this excercise, lets see if I can figure that out.)

### How do you use this thing?
Well, it's Git. Git reprents the divergence and convergence of code over time. Well, how about instead of code, we use that to represent ideas. Ideas in the form of paragraphs of a 'Living CV'. Want to see the history as a timeline? Look at the git history in something like [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or [gitup](http://gitup.co/). The words describe those things.
