## More on Games
So, I started off with games, and they have pretty much influenced me a lot throughout my journey to where I am now, in timeline terms some more relevant learnings from my teenage years leading to university relate to more fearless destruction, experimentation, networking and the limitations of computing power forcing more learning.

### You dirty cheat
Again, in the olden days, before the proliferation of connectivity to the internet for the world and its dog, magazines were a staple source of information on upcoming games, new hardware and cheats.

Cheats usually involved opening up hex editor, carefully following instructions to manipulate a very specific row, starting from a very specific character, and woe betide you if you got it wrong.

What this also encouraged was more reckless hacking. Character names and other menu items got changed for utterly juvenile reasons, random characters swapped just to see what happened (usually you wrecked the game, always back stuff up) and eventually figuring out that, actually, if you dig around folders you can find source files for sounds and more!

### Minimum Requirements
Anyone who's immediate response to seeing a game in a store is to look at the back usually on the bottom left to read the 'minimum requirements' will get this. More often than not, a new game demanded that you have more memory, more hard drive space and more graphical processing power than lawnmower man, or if you go back a bit further, you could install a soundcard for realistic sounds.

This meant, when savings permitted, new components were acquired and had to be installed. Again a fearlessness of all things electronic resulted in opening up the belly of the mechanical beasts and getting in amongst the motherboard, and miraculously I never messed it up. My Dad however, somehow managed to fry a machine once by attaching a dongle (a hardware protection device) the wrong way round. I don't even know how that's possible.

My previous lessons from the days of DOS games added value here too, disabling unecessary settings and background programs, learning a bit about how different things can affect the performance of your precious game!

### LAN Party
One of the final lessons from my teenage years was in Networking. Games, thanks to their introduction of multi-player action, often included instructions on setting up your own network, so we did, lugging full on desktops and CRT monitors round to an appointed house, along with all sorts of cabling. Some rapid learning here included the reason for crossover cables, network hubs, terrible workgroup based networking for windows.

### And?
Well, I guess the main thing here, again, is that it reinforced the idea that you could to an awful lot with a computer and that they were not a thing to be feared.
